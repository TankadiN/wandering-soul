#### v0.5.1.0
Readded custom component icons back to settings

 - Added functionality to icon settings switching between one and two column view if window gets too small
 - Improved visualisation of icon settings

Some of the settings still need tweaked slightly for various reasons (window size, ease of access etc.).
Will improve throughout v0.5 before jumping on to Hierarchy redesigns.
Later reworking of `ComponentTypes` is required as it's not the most flexible structure.

#### v0.5.0.0
 Settings redesign!

 - Removed single tab view due to it being a waste of space, and slow navigation.
 - Combined tabs into a single view with foldout displays.
 - Component Icon Types all display in settings as foldouts.
 - Component Icons can now all be enabled or disabled per type.
 - Prefixes can now all be expanded or hidden in settings.

#### v0.4.6.5
 - Removed Style Tab as it served very little purpose, settings will be added elsewhere
 - Fixed a bug with static references targeting the previously destroyed SerializableObject for settings

#### v0.4.6.4
 - Settings now correctly create new ScriptableObjects when one does not exist
 - Temporary defaults for Settings have been added until a more refined setup is made

#### v0.4.6.3
Fixed General Settings not saving

 - Lightened up the names of some of the classes as they were a little over the top

#### v0.4.6.2
Can now move settings asset around the project.

 - Path to current settings now saved in `EditorPrefs`. Will only create a new settings asset if one cannot be found within the project files
 - Checkboxes for objects have been hidden in the Prefab Editor to stop the overlap of the show/hide child toggles
 - Continuation of clean up, this time for the HierarchySettings class, see `AssetUtility.cs`

#### v0.4.6.1
Restructure of hierarchy decorator calls for correct two tone display

 - Seperated label GUI into it's own method
 - Darkened the selection and added a white tint when selected with two tone on
 - Fixed a bug that stopped the foldouts appearing correctly
 - Added padding to about tab
 - Tweaked some colours in default prefixes
 - Pull Request from @KreliStudio to add Enable/Disable buttons for all icon catergories

#### v0.4.6
- Fixed a bug where the bottom-most instance in the hierarchy could not be occasionally selected
- Added MonoBehaviour Icon Support. This can be toggled on/off to show all MonoBehaviour types as icons.
- Added Custom MonoBehaviour icons support. Within the Icon Tab, there is now a Custom Icon Catergory, that will allow users to select MonoBehaviours Directly. This will not only display the script if it's an existing component, 
but the custom icon for them too.

#### v0.4.5.1
- Custom GUIStyles now appear as a dropdown in the prefix style selection for easier switching

#### v0.4.5
- Setting tabs are now setup in their own individual classes
- Improved caching throughout due to this
- LayerMasks can now be changed from the Hierarchy (multi or single select)
- LayerMask display now has it's own settings catergory in the global settings tab

#### v0.4.4
